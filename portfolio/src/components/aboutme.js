                Welcome to my page, my name is Arnold Diep.
                I recently graduated from University of Washington Coding Boot Camp program, with an intent of becoming a Software Developer.
                I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health in 2016.
                I have 2+ years of experience in Occupational Health and Safety, with my recent employment as a Safety Specialist contractor to Everett Boeing.
                While working there, I've had the privilege to work with a handful of Service Providers (subcontractors), such as Skanska, Kiewit, VECA, and ChemTreat.</p> 
                <br></br>
                <p>Prior to the bootcamp, I had no coding experience but I have documented my successes and challenges of my journey by taking on weekly application project.
                I enjoy coding more and more now that have the grasp on the fundamentals.
                Leveraging from my past experience and with the bootcamp support, I can confidently apply HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, and Git knowledge to create a meaningful, engaging, and impactful experiences for my users.
